The testhw and the Testing directory are now available for use
in ~ssdavis/154/p5. Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your vm.cpp file.
testhw places all of the results in results.txt in 
the directory with the source files in it.
